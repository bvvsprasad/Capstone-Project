    "I am a business analyst residing in Southbank Melbourne. I currently live within walking distance to Melbourne CBD and Flinders station and I enjoy many amenities and venues in the area, such as various international cuisine restaurants, cafes, shopping malls and entertainment. I currently work in a bank within walking distance to my home. However, I have been offered an opportunity to work for a leading consulting firm in Manhattan, NY. They will leverage my BA skills and newly acquired data science to help their business analytics team. I am unsure about taking the role and would like to use this opportunity to dedicate my final coursera project into investigating advantages and disadvatanges of taking this offer.The key question is : How much do I need to spend in comparison to Melbourne to find an apartment with my girl friend which is as convenient and affordable as mine in Melbourne, considering the salary difference. I can use available real estate websites and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "*Desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within (1.5 km) radius or less than 30 minutes walking distance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\n",
    "\n",
    "*Top amenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n",
    "\n",
    "*Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, Asian and Japanese/Korean Restaurants, gym and Grocery stores nearby\n",
    "\n",
    "*As a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Melbourne\n"

    "Using the \"one consolidated map\" above, I was able to explore all possibilities since the popups provided the information needed for a good data-driven decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apartment 1 rent cost is US$7500, which is slightly above the meddian of US7000. Apt 1 is located 400 meters from subway station at 59th Street and work place (Park Ave and 53rd) is another 600 meters away. I can walk to work place and use subway for other purposes. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 2 and it is located in a fine district in the East side of Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apartment 2 rent cost is US6935, just under the US$7000 median. Apt 2 is located 60 meters from subway station at Fulton Street, but I will have to ride the subway daily to work , possibly 40-60 min ride. Venues for this apt are as of Cluster 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on current Southbank venues, I feel that Cluster 3 type of venues is a closer resemblance to my current place. That means that APARTMENT 2 is a better choice and cheaper which means I can use it for other expenses. However, there is the issue of transport.\n",
    "5.0 DISCUSSION\n",
    "5.1.Elaboration and discussion on any observations and/or recommendations for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that conveinience and location both matter a lot. Having to spend $ 7000 for rent is very high considering I am paying closer to $ 2000 USD a month in Southbank and enjoying life. I believe my income should be enough to justiy rent of 30-35%. However the US opportunity is closer to 50% of the total, meaning that I am better off staying in Melbourne and looking for another opportunity.\n",

    "In terms of the Coursera course: In general, I am very impressed with the overall organisation, content and lab works presented during the Coursera IBM Certification Course. It helped me learn variety of data science tools with my zero previous knowledge of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel this Capstone project presented me a great opportunity to practice and apply the Data Science tools and methodologies learned. I have created a good project that I can present as an example to show my potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel I have acquired a good starting point to become a professional Data Scientist and I will continue exploring to creating examples of practical cases.\n",
    "6.0 Conclusion\n",
    "6.1.Desicison taken and Report Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided not to move to the US and stay in Melbourne consdiering the prices. I will explore Los Angeles for future career opportunities and run the same cost benefit analysis to make an informed data driven decision.\n",
    "Final feedback on the overal data science course\n",
    "\n",
    "I am very happy to be able to complete the 9 course specialisation in 6 months with on and off time and money spent. While not in the data science area career wise, this will not help me manage data scientists in the team better and align expectations with possiblities. The mapping with Folium is a very powerful technique to consolidate information and make the analysis and decision thoroughly and with confidence. I would recommend for use in similar situations."
